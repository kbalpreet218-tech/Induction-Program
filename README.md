## Day 1

### My First Day at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) 

My first day at GNDEC began with a spiritual visit to the Gurdwara Sahib from 8:30 AM to 10:30 AM. The session included the recitation of Japji Sahib and Chaupai Sahib, followed by Kirtan, Ardaas, and the Hukamnama. This peaceful and uplifting start set a positive tone for the day.
The welcome address was delivered by our senior, Ms. Taranpreet Kaur, who shared that the college is proudly celebrating its 70th Golden Jubilee, marking seven decades of excellence in education.

Following this, Harsimran Singh Jaggi introduced us to the college's key features, including its state-of-the-art infrastructure, facilities, accreditations, research opportunities, and active student clubs. He also shared the historical background of GNDEC, highlighting that the institution was established by the Nankana Sahib Education Trust with the mission to uplift rural education. Notably, 70% of the seats at GNDEC are reserved for students from rural backgrounds to ensure equitable access to quality education. The foundation stone of the college was laid by the first President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, on April 8, 1956.   

We were then inspired by an alumnus, Mr. Sagam Arora, topper of the 2021–2025 batch, who is currently working as a Software Engineer at Arguesoft. Another distinguished alumnus, Arshpreet Singh, also from the 2021–2025 IT batch, addressed us and shared his journey. He is currently working as an Automation Engineer at Airtel, Gurugram.
The session concluded with a motivational speech by Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal, Head of the Department of Applied Sciences. She encouraged us to focus on self-discipline, personal growth, and consistent effort during our next four years, guiding us on how to make the most of this important phase of our academic and personal journey.The event continued with an inspiring address by the Chief Guest, Dr. Rakesh Kumar, a proud alumnus of GNDEC from the 1991 batch. He spoke warmly about his time at the college, sharing personal experiences that highlighted the strong academic foundation, values, and culture of the institution. His words resonated with us, offering both motivation and a sense of belonging as we begin our own journey here.

Following the session, we were escorted to our respective departments, officially marking the start of our academic life at GNDEC.






# Day - 2

Day 2 commenced with an English proficiency test, followed by a Mathematics proficiency test conducted by our seniors. After a brief break, we gathered in the auditorium for an insightful expert lecture by Dr. Arashdeep Singh on the topic "Food: A Pivotal Role in a Student's Overall Wellness." He shared valuable guidance on how college students can maintain their health through proper nutrition and made us aware of the available food and health facilities. The day concluded with an interactive session conducted by the Causmic Club, along with the official launch of the Introduction Activities, sparking excitement and involvement among the students.





# Day - 3 

The third day of my college journey was enriching, marked by valuable learning, engaging interactions, and inspiring leadership. 

The day began with an insightful lecture by Dr. Jaswinder Singh, in charge of IAPT, who spoke with clarity, passion, and depth. His words were both motivational and thought-provoking, and his dynamic approach to the session left a strong impression on me. I found his lecture truly inspiring, encouraging me to approach my academic journey with greater enthusiasm and purpose.


### UNIVERSAL HUMAN VALUES 

Our second lecture was on Universal Human Values, a subject that really made me pause and reflect. We talked about what happiness and contentment truly mean, and how they influence the way we think, act, and make decisions every day. The session felt more like a conversation than a lecture—it opened up new ways of looking at life and what it means to feel genuinely fulfilled. Hearing real-life experiences from others made everything more relatable and meaningful, and I walked away with a clearer sense of what truly matters.
