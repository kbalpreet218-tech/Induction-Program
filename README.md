### My First Day at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) 

My first day at GNDEC began with a spiritual visit to the Gurdwara Sahib from 8:30 AM to 10:30 AM. The session included the recitation of Japji Sahib and Chaupai Sahib, followed by Kirtan, Ardaas, and the Hukamnama. This peaceful and uplifting start set a positive tone for the day.
The welcome address was delivered by our senior, Ms. Taranpreet Kaur, who shared that the college is proudly celebrating its 70th Golden Jubilee, marking seven decades of excellence in education.

Following this, Harsimran Singh Jaggi introduced us to the college's key features, including its state-of-the-art infrastructure, facilities, accreditations, research opportunities, and active student clubs. He also shared the historical background of GNDEC, highlighting that the institution was established by the Nankana Sahib Education Trust with the mission to uplift rural education. Notably, 70% of the seats at GNDEC are reserved for students from rural backgrounds to ensure equitable access to quality education. The foundation stone of the college was laid by the first President of India, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, on April 8, 1956.   

We were then inspired by an alumnus, Mr. Sagam Arora, topper of the 2021–2025 batch, who is currently working as a Software Engineer at Arguesoft. Another distinguished alumnus, Arshpreet Singh, also from the 2021–2025 IT batch, addressed us and shared his journey. He is currently working as an Automation Engineer at Airtel, Gurugram.
The session concluded with a motivational speech by Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal, Head of the Department of Applied Sciences. She encouraged us to focus on self-discipline, personal growth, and consistent effort during our next four years, guiding us on how to make the most of this important phase of our academic and personal journey.The event continued with an inspiring address by the Chief Guest, Dr. Rakesh Kumar, a proud alumnus of GNDEC from the 1991 batch. He spoke warmly about his time at the college, sharing personal experiences that highlighted the strong academic foundation, values, and culture of the institution. His words resonated with us, offering both motivation and a sense of belonging as we begin our own journey here.

Following the session, we were escorted to our respective departments, officially marking the start of our academic life at GNDEC.
