Our second lecture was on Universal Human Values, a subject that really made me pause and reflect. We talked about what happiness and contentment truly mean, and how they influence the way we think, act, and make decisions every day. The session felt more like a conversation than a lecture—it opened up new ways of looking at life and what it means to feel genuinely fulfilled. Hearing real-life experiences from others made everything more relatable and meaningful, and I walked away with a clearer sense of what truly matters.


# Day - 4

### "P2P class"

My day at college begins with a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lecture, led by our seniors from the D-2 and D-3 years.

Our seniors explain each concept with great clarity and ensure that every doubt is addressed thoughtfully. Their method of teaching not only enhances our understanding but also makes learning C++ an enjoyable experience.

After the break, we attended a thought-provoking lecture in the auditorium by Dr. Priya Darshani on the topic of Universal Human Values. She emphasized the importance of values such as empathy, honesty, respect, compassion, and responsibility in shaping a meaningful and fulfilling life. The session encouraged us to reflect on how our thoughts, decisions, and actions impact not only ourselves but also those around us. Universal Human Values are the fundamental principles that guide human conduct and promote harmony within individuals, in relationships, and in society. Dr. Priya’s engaging talk helped us understand how living by these values can lead to both personal growth and a more compassionate world.

"Our day began at 9:00 A.M. with the process of getting our ID cards made. While we waited for our turn, a few of us decided to take a walk around the campus—and honestly, we were amazed. The college had such a peaceful vibe, with open green spaces, clean pathways, and buildings that looked both modern and welcoming. We peeked into classrooms, passed by vibrant notice boards, and even saw students chatting and laughing in common areas. It all felt so alive and full of possibilities. That little walk made us even more excited to start this new chapter here."

### "CHEMISTRY LECTURE"

"Our Chemistry lecture was taken by Professor Karan Bhalla, and right from the start, he had a calm and approachable presence. He began by introducing us to the basics of the subject, explaining concepts in a way that actually made them feel understandable—not overwhelming. What stood out the most was how he encouraged us to ask questions and made sure no one felt left behind. It didn’t feel like a typical lecture—it felt more like a conversation. His genuine passion for Chemistry came through in the way he spoke, and it made me feel a lot more confident and curious about the subject."

### "ENGLISH LECTURE"

"After the Chemistry lecture, we had our English class with Professor Nisha. Her warm and friendly nature immediately put us at ease. She introduced the course with a gentle yet confident tone, making the subject feel approachable and enjoyable. Rather than diving straight into heavy material, she focused on building a connection with us—encouraging us to express ourselves and highlighting the importance of communication skills in both academic and real-life situations. It was a refreshing session that left many of us feeling motivated and excited to improve our English."

He introduced us to the purpose and vision of the CML, explaining how it’s designed to support holistic student growth beyond academics. Through his talk, we learned that CML encourages creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and real-world problem-solving—skills essential for success in today’s world. Dr. Lakhvir Singh spoke with genuine passion and clarity, which made us realize how many exciting opportunities await us if we choose to step out of our comfort zones and actively participate in the learning process."
